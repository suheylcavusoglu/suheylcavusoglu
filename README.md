# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

- I am a Ph.D. student in Environmental Engineering.
- During my master's degree, I focused on multi-media environmental modeling.
- You can find my master's thesis [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suheylcavusoglu) and our project's code [here](https://github.com/rkgoktas/BETR-QWASI-LU-v1.0).
- I have a keen interest in data science and machine learning.
- My goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to environmental systems.

## Projects

- In my projects, I primarily work on environmental data analysis, prediction, and modeling.
- I focus on detecting and solving environmental problems using machine learning algorithms.
- I utilize data science tools such as Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc., to carry out my projects.

## Technologies and Tools

- Python: I use Python for developing machine learning models and performing data analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook: I leverage Jupyter Notebook for project development and result visualization.
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn: These are some of the commonly used tools for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling.
